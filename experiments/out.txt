##  About Cookies

Cookies and related technologies (herein “Cookies”) are small text files that
a website saves on your computer when you visit the site. Cookies the
University sets are called first-party Cookies. The data collected might be

about you, your device, your preferences, or your login information. This data
is mostly used to make the website work as expected so, for example, you don’t
have to keep re-entering your credentials whenever you come back to the site.
Cookies set by third parties are called third-party Cookies. We use third-
party Cookies for analyzing website traffic and our advertising and marketing
efforts. We have divided the Cookies we use into the following categories:
Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functional, and Targeting. Under each
category heading below you will find a general description of the Cookies in
each category. You can change your browser settings to block, delete, or alert

###  Cookie Categories

####  Strictly Necessary Cookies

Always Active

Strictly Necessary Cookies are first-party Cookies that are necessary for the
website to function. They can be either permanent or temporary and are usually
only set in response to actions made directly by you that amount to a request
for services, such as logging in or filling in forms. For example, we use
Strictly Necessary Cookies to handle user registration and login. Some sites
require the use of Strictly Necessary Cookies to access the site, such as
University websites requiring University credentialed authentication. If you
set your browser to block or delete Cookies, you may not be able to access the
site or some parts of the site will not work.

####  Performance Cookies

Always Active

Performance Cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can
measure and improve the performance and effectiveness of University websites.

Performance Cookies also help the University understand which webpages are the
most and least popular, see how visitors move around the site, and determine
whether webpage content is relevant to user interests. Performance Cookies may
be first-party or third party, permanent or temporary, and do not personally
identify individual visitors. Some Performance Cookies are “analytics” Cookies
(e.g., Google Analytics), using third-party software tools, which help us
understand more about how our websites are used and where visitors come from
by collecting and aggregating anonymous information on the pages visited and
any advertisements viewed. The University does not take responsibility for the
collection, use, and management of data by any third-party software tool
provider unless required to do so by applicable law. If you set your browser
to block or delete Cookies, some site services and functionalities may not
work.

####  Functional Cookies

Always Active


Functional Cookies enhance the performance and functionality of our websites
but are non-essential to their use. These permanent Cookies allow our website
to remember information from your previous visits, such as details you
submitted before or your previously stated preferences. These Cookies may also
be used to provide services you request, such as newsletters or publications.
They may be first- or third-party Cookies that enable services we have added
to our webpages. If you set your browser to block or delete Cookies, some or
all of these services may not function properly.

####  Targeting Cookies

Always Active

Targeting Cookies are used to deliver content tailored to your interests and
may be temporary or permanent. They may also be first-party or third-party
Cookies. Targeting Cookies are based on uniquely identifying your browser and
device; they do not store information such as your name. The University may

use targeting Cookies prepared by the University, its third-party contractors,
or advertising partnersto provide you with personalized University display
advertising and promotional material about the University and its programs.
The University may also allow third parties to place Cookies on your device
that collect and use anonymous information about your visits to, and
interactions with, our websites to personalize advertisements and promotional
materials for University goods and services. Targeting Cookies may be used by
our third-party contractors or our advertising partners to build a profile of
your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. We may
share information about your use of our site with our social media,
advertising, and analytics partners who may combine it with other information
that you have provided to them or that they have collected from your use of
their services. If you set your browser to block or delete Cookies, you will

still see advertisements, but they will be less targeted to your interests.
