## Protocol
1. Begin by brainstorming and listing out various website categories, such as e-commerce, news, blog posts, social media, educational sites, etc. This will ensure diversity in the dataset.
2. For each category, conduct thorough research to gather a substantial number of webpages, aiming for around 10 representative examples. Ensure that the selected webpages are of high quality and accurately represent the category.
3. Determine the specific types of questions you intend to cover in the dataset. Consider a range of question types and specific to each website category.
4. Generate a comprehensive list of questions for each webpage, covering all the identified question types. The questions should be relevant and unambiguous.
5. Format the dataset entries consistently, following the structure: (full HTML, question, answer). The full HTML allows for context and reference, while the question and answer fields should be concise, clear, and representative of the content within the webpage.
6. Ensure that the dataset is well-organized and documented. Use appropriate labels or tags to indicate the website category, question type, and other relevant information for easy reference and analysis.
