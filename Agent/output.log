China's economy is projected to slow in 2022. After a strong start in early 2022, the largest COVID-19 wave in two years has disrupted China's growth normalization. We project real GDP growth to slow sharply to 4.3 percent in 2022 - 0.8 percentage points lower than projected in the December China Economic Update.

China's economy is projected to slow in 2022. After a strong start in early 2022, the largest COVID-19 wave in two years has disrupted China's growth normalization. We project real GDP growth to slow sharply to 4.3 percent in 2022 - 0.8 percentage points lower than projected in the December China Economic Update.
