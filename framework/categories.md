# Reflections

- The search query changes the optimal strategy significantly. If the used search query is right, Google can return the excerpt or table from relevant sources and surface them directly on the search result page.

- If we reformalate the problem as a graph search problem where an agent must choose keywords to search and then navigate through pages of content and deciding when to backtrack, the model needs to be fairly capable and accurate at updating search plans to adapt to challenging scenarios.
